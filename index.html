        College is an integral part of a student's education. It helps set up the pathway toward success. Entrance into the student's college of choice is dependent upon the college admission process. College admission officers take several factors into account in deciding whether a student should be admitted into their school or not.

        Our team at CollegeHelper has crafted a tool in order to inform students about their chances of making their college of choice. The chatbot cannot take into account all of the factors that college admission officers use in deciding whether a student is a perfect fit for their university or not. 
        Therefore, our chatbot is not 100% accurate.
        However, our chatbot uses GPA levels and SAT/ACT scores to calculate a reliable percentage based on a student's chance of making his or her college of choice. The chatbot is an extension of our College Chances App which you can see in the third tab. Our website also includes a Question and Answer Service (QAS) which gives information about ten universities that you wish to know more about. Feel free to switch between the tabs.

        <b>What are GPA, SAT, and ACT?</b>
      </h2>
        <p>
          <b>
          GPA, SAT, and ACT are scores that factor into the college admission process. GPA is a long-term score that measures success in high school throughout the freshman, sophomore, junior, and senior grade levels. The GPA is a score on a scale from 0.0 to 4.0 that serves as an average of the GPAs received in your high school classes. The GPAs in your classes are determined based on the grade you receive in the class. How does this factor into college admissions you might ask? Colleges have GPA requirements based on the level of education your major provides at your school of choice. The measure of your GPA shows colleges that you can perform well in their classes.
          </b> 
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>  
          SAT and ACT are national college admission exams that students must submit to their colleges of choice. They are taken on a single day in the time you are enrolled in your high school, but they are crucial in the college admission process. They show how well you perform on exams and serve as a measure of what you've learned in high school. The SAT is administered under the CollegeBoard and is scored on a scale of 400-1600, while the ACT is administered under the ACT organization and is scored on a scale of 1-36. How does this factor into college admissions you might ask? Admission officers have requirements of SAT/ACT scores based on the major you apply to and may use these scores to compare you to other applicants.
